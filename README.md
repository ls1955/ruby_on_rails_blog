# Description
This repo is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-blog-app).

A simple blog web application has been created by simply following the guides from [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#adding-a-second-model) up until section 9.2.

In order to see the web application live, click [here](https://rubyonrailsblog-production.up.railway.app/).

# Note:
After adding pg(postgresql) gem in Gemfile and Gemfile.lock for deployment, the application is unable to run on local server as the bundle could not install pg gem.
